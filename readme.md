#Interactive HDR viewer using canvas

This is an idea on how to view HDR images interactively using canvas. 
Move your mouse to get local adaption for that area. 

This code was demoed at the third [CopenhagenJS](http://copenhagenjs.dk) meetup on 2011-10-20.

Check the slideshow on [Slideshare](http://slidesha.re/r5n7ai).
